# NEONSoils
NEONSoils is a repository code to acquire, tidy, and compute soil respiration fluxes at NEON sites using the flux-gradient method. 

**This is an early prototype package and should not be used for research purposes until scientifically validated.**

An online applet for visualization at select NEON sites is found [here](https://jmzobitz.shinyapps.io/NEON-soil-fluxes/)

## Installation 
Installation in R is done through the devtools package:

`devtools::install_github("jmzobitz/NEONSoils", build = TRUE, build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"),force=TRUE)`

## Usage
To analyze fluxes once the package is installed requires a two step process:

1. First acquire the NEON data, following conventions of `loadByProduct` function in the `neonUtilities` package.
` acquire_neon_data(site_name ="SJER",`
                  start_date = "2020-06",
                  end_date = "2020-06",
                  data_file_name = "my-file-2020-06.Rda") `

2. Then process and compute fluxes.
` out_fluxes_jan <- compute_neon_flux(input_file_name = "my-file-2020-06.Rda",
                                      out_flux_file_name = "my-file-flux-2020-06.Rda") `
